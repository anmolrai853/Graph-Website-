      <h2>Town design</h2>
      <div class="container">
        <img src="town 1.png" alt="My graph Algorithm" style="max-width:20%; height: auto;" />
        <p>I'll be navigating through two existing towns along with a new one, using a graph algorithm. The algorithm
          works by systematically exploring all nodes, organizing them based on the lowest weight connections. It begins
          with a node, identifying the subsequent nodes with the lowest possible weight. This process continues until
          reaching the destination, constantly considering previous nodes to potentially find lighter pathways.

          The image on the right displays town 1, factoring in all values, including risk assessments, while the picture
          on the left portrays the town without these considerations.</p>

      <div class="container">
        <img src="town 2.png" alt="My graph Algorithm" style="max-width:20%; height: auto;" />
        <p>
          The image on the right presents town 2, annotated with the risk multiplier integrated.The left image remains
          the original reference. In this,more activity clustered
          in the center indicates that the path will probably avoid this area, this will favour routes along the sides.
          When
          encountering edges with equal weight but varying activity levels, the algorithm prioritizes paths with lower
          activity to ensure a safer route.

      <h2>Ethical</h2>
      <p>Choosing to go for a utilitarian approach when designing an algorithm will mean it will provide the greatest
        good for the most people. This means that when travelling through a route it will choose what is faster as well
        as minimizing the overall risk, this can be done by taking routes that have less traffic so that there is lower
        risk of accidents, even at the compromise of taking longer.
        Utilitarianism will also take into account multiples things such as safety, distance, time and other concepts to
        make the commute more efficient for the largest amount of people. The areas in the map will show the level of
        activity from the lowest to the highest. If a path is slower by taking a lower risk area instead of a higher
        risk, it will choose to go through that route, instead of the fastest. There are however exceptions if it is a
        short distance. </p>
      <p> Below shows town 1 labelled with a risk multipler that will be used</p>

      <h2>Step by Step Algorithm</h2>
      <div class="imgcontainer">
        <img src="algo1.png" alt="My graph Algorithm" style="max-width:35%; height: auto;" />
        <img src="algo2.png" alt="My graph Algorithm" style="max-width:35%; height: auto;" />
        <p>The simplified image of my algorithm's functioning in a risk-free scenario is shown in the diagram on the
          left.
          They show how to explore both recent and previous nodes to find the lowest weight while making sure that
          going back to earlier points is avoided. The path's finalised visual depiction can be found on the right.</p>

      <h2>Algorithm</h2>
      <div class="container">
        <img src="town 1 done.png" alt="town 1 done" style="max-width:40%; height: auto;" />
        <img src="8.png" alt="town 2 done" style="max-width:45%; height: auto;">
      </div>
      <p>The images above show town 1 and 2 following my algorithm which is shown using a yellow line, as previous said
        it explores other nodes while not going in a loop by avoiding repetition. This is done by adding all nodes
        visited in a queue.</p>

      <h2>Testing</h2>
      <div class="container">
        <img src="own town.png" alt="My graph Algorithm" style="max-width:35%; height: auto;">
        <p>
          This custom map, designed similar to the previous towns, follows the same algorithm
          guidelines to ensure an efficient path. The left-side image displays the map with weight indicators, while the
          right-side image illustrates a yellow path, showing the traversal route.
